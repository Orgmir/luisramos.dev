# luisramos.dev

Luis personal website built using Gatsby, React, Tailwind and Node.js.

## Note

Coming from the mobile space, I always felt attraction to the javascript tools and dev environment. This website acts as a playground for me to experiment with the javascript world, and I have open sourced for you to see how easy you can make something from scratch these days. I started with the `gatsby new luisramos.dev` command, and everything else came with a bit of googling, so I encourage you to go ahead and build your own thing!

## Contributing

## Acknowledgements

I have to give a big thanks to [taniarascia.com](taniarascia.com), since her migration post from wordpress to gatsby got me into migrating my blog from hugo.
