I recently developed and published [Ler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.luisramos.ler), an RSS aggregator app, and I want to showcase some examples of the architecture I used for it. In particular I wanna talk Use cases!

Starting a new project is always a great oppurtunity to do some research, learn new stuff, and put those learnings into practice. There is a lot of reading material around Use Cases, and its place in the _Clean Architecture_,  but I don't find enough examples online of how they are actually used in a production environment.

I will do a detailed post about Ler architecture, and the hows and whys of how it ended up like it did, but in this post I wanna focus on Use Cases. So lets talk a bit about what is my definition of a Use Case, why should you be using them, why coroutines are great, and also give you some code examples of the Use Cases on the Ler app.

### What is a Use Case?



### The Case for Use Cases

### Use them!
