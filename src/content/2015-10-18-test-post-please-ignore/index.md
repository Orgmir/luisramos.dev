Hey, I'm creating this to see if I can finally settle the toughs that come to me while I code away. I find that I should write down something so future me can make use of the troubles I go through, but the past me never got around to actually do something. Let's see if this time is the charm.

I plan to write about software, mobile programming, the weather and whatever I feel like (that means gaming probably).

Let's do this!
